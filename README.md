1. Nucleic acid sequence
2. Amino acid 1 sequence (based on RF1 study), Optional.
3. Amino acid 2 sequence (based on RF2 study), Optional.

Amino acid 1 score is normalized by its nucleic acid sequence. And Amino acid 2 score is normalized by both of the nucleic acid sequence & amino acid 1 seqeunce.

For details see the papers in the reference directory.
